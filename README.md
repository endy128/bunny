# Bunny Sega MegaDrive Demo

Quick demo of a game which runs on the Sega MegaDrive / Genesis. You can contol a character, move in eight directions and shoot carrots in all directions.

Written in C using the [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK)

I created all the pixel art and animations myself using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). Sorry about the crappy video capture. This was tested on a MiSTerFPGA running the MegaDrive core, but should run on real hardware.
